To authenticate a user, a POST request can be made to the `/user/authenticate` path with the `name` and `email` parameters. To get a user by ID, a GET request can be made to the `/user/get/{id}` path. To update a user, a PUT request can be made to the `/user/update/{id}` path with the user's new data in the request body. To delete a user, a DELETE request can be made to the `/user/delete/{id}` path.
